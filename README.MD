## Project Description
For our final project we will develop a climate control system for a small area such as a bedroom. A small space heater will be used to heat the room and will be controlled by a Raspberry Pi. A client application will be developed to allow a user to remotely set and adjust the desired temperature of the room. The Raspberry Pi will use a temperature sensor to get the temperature of the room. Together, the Raspberry Pi will control the space heater to get the room to the desired temperature based on the current temperature of the room collected from the temperature sensor.
